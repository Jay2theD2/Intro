Questions from Fin Tech Master Folder/ 1.1 Class Activites/ 0.1 Work Repo/Intro questions


    * Who are you? 



I'm Jay Davis.
I was born into a mennonite family in the conservative small town of Elmira Ontario.
I had a great childhood filled with sports, music, nature, and lots of love.
All of these things are still important to me today. 
 

   * What is your background?


Professional actor, Carpenter, Friend, Partner, and Michael Buble Tribute Artist. 


 I started my career as a dancer/singer with Holland America Cruise Lines in 1997. Since then I have worked as a lead vocalist for Disney, Princess Cruise Lines, the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Niagara Symphony Orchestra. I have appeared in numerous commercials for Honda, Porsche, Ritz Crackers, and Target to name a few. I have acted in several tv shows like Titans, Designated Survivor, The Firm, and The Handmaids Tale. I have a varied and extensive resume in England, Germany, and Canada with over 100 professional credits on stage and screen.  Most recently I was a member of the first international Tony award winning Broadway Show, Dear Evan Hansen.

I also have a love of building and carpentry. I started working construction in 2007 as a way to supplement my acting income. Eventually I branched out on my own and have specialized in decks, porches, and furniture refinishing. There are several examples of my carpentry work scattered around Toronto neighborhoods. You can view my furniture business on Instagram: @rockstarusedfurniture



    * What are your career goals?

I would like to be in a position where I can create and imagine new possibilites with a sustainable and stable income, and the ability to work remotely. So far my goals include: Creating a shared solar energy grid, and taking part in the infinite practical applications of NFTs.




    * Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?


I stumbled upon this industry through researching how to invest the money I had saved from my furniture business. I went down the rabbit hole from the collapse of the fiat system to Bitcoin, and then deeper and deeper into DeFi, and the inner working of Blockchain. My imagination was sparked like it had never been before. I was obsessed for months. The deeper I got the more I wanted to learn. Eventually my partner suggested that I find a support group for people obsessed with Blockchain technology. When I came across the FinTech bootcamp online I finally decided where I was going to invest my money....in myself:)
